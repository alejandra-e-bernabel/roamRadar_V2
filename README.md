# roamRadar_V2
A travel itinerary storage app. Updated from version without mobile use.

# Disclaimer 
This project was originally made as part of a team over a period of two weeks. After the team finished the project, I decided I wanted to update it to be more mobile-friendly and finish polishing css and other functionalities. The original team was composed of:

https://github.com/Saragar710 (Sara)
Created the restaurant.html page, js, and css. Also created index.html.

https://github.com/Angeldog27 (Abigail)
Created the budget.html, js, and css.

https://github.com/NicoleT27 (Nicole)
Created the location.html page, js, and css. She also created the nav bar that is present in most pages.

https://github.com/Yowiesenfeld (Yo)
Created the hotels.html, js, and css. Also created the flight2.html, js, and css.

I was responsible for the login page and the thingsToDo.html and their associated css and js files.

Together, we made the navbar.html page, which houses the main layout of our itinerary page.
